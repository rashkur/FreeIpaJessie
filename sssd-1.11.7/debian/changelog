      (Closes: #595564).
    - Fix tight-loop bug on systems with older OpenLDAP client
      libraries (such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5)
  * New Upstream Version 1.2.3:
    - Resolves CVE-2010-2940.
  * New Upstream Version 1.2.2:
    - The LDAP provider no longer requires access to the LDAP

    - Significant performance improvement when performing initgroups
      on users who are members of large groups in LDAP.

    to make sure local users can have their password set even if
    sssd is enabled.
  * Rename pam-configs/sssd to pam-configs/sss, to have a name that
    is consistent with the package name libpam-sss.
  * Add VCS links to the GIT repository.
  * Move configuration API documentation from /etc/sssd/ to
    /usr/share/doc/sssd/.  It is not configuration and do not belong
    in /etc/.
  * Drop autoconf, automake, libtool, m4 and autotools-dev from
    build-depends.  There is no need to regenerate the build files any
    more.

  [ Morten Werner Forsbring ]
  * Add dnsutils as build-dependency.
